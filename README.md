Mysensors Garage Door Sensor - With Battery and Tilt Sensor

Project Uses Mysensors 2.2 or 2.3 Libraries.

Also I have attached a 3d Case of My Design for use with EasyPCB for RFM69

I Powerd this project with an old Laptop Cell.  Use the +3.3V side and Voltage Regulator LE33 which is a LDO regulator.
So far the device has been running for 3 Months with only a .5 voltage drop.

Pictures and Circuit Diagram to come.

Get a good ball tilt sensor.  Cheap ones will not work well.
